  Indonesia is having an increasing surge of published scientific articles
  during recent years. In medical science, published articles greatly vary
  from both pre-clinical and clinical studies where each study possesses
  different methodological approach and hypothetical premises. However, some
  articles do not include a rigorous documentation as to make it reproducible.
  Moreover, the lack of centralized database further impedes researcher from
  reanalyzing previous findings and integrating them with the new study. This
  paper delineates such an issue by constructing a graph database to
  centralize and integrate clinical research data. Database is constructed using
  `Neo4j` and `cypher` querying language populated with 5,000 medical records
  generated by `synthea` program. Our database able to answer queries
  requiring complex relationship while minimizing the amount of database hits.
  As a concluding remark, graph database is quite performant to solve data
  integration and centralization issue faced by life science research
  institutes.

#  Introduction

Scientific publication in Indonesia underwent manifold increases within the
past decades. Reported by @Maula2018, numbers of published article on
dengue-related subject increased 13 times in 2017 as compared to 2007. Such an
increase also followed by *h-index* improvement, resulting in Indonesia placed
as the 5^th^ most scientifically productive ASEAN country in investigating
dengue-related topic [@Maula2018]. Another bibliometric analysis investigated
by @Sarwar2015 also enlisted Indonesia within 11 most scientifically productive
Islamic countries. However, these articles often neither robustly elaborate the
methodological procedure nor provide obtained data for reanalysis, two factors
contributing to reproducibility and credibility issue in scientific publication
[@Pashler2012; @Stark2018; @Resnik2016]. Besides enabling preprint access
[@OakdenRayner2018] and thorough documentation on methodology, data
availability is also a crucial component for reproducibility in science
[@Peng2015]. Therefore, we proposed utilizing graph database to integrate
research findings in life science-related fields.

## Graph Database

Data management system should appropriately consider interoperability and
scalability which enable data storing, indexing and retrieving. Databases
aggregate integrated object in a structure defined by its metadata. The
presence of metadata implies a self-defined property of the database, whereas in
relational database management system (RDBMS) such definition included within
its particular schema [@Berg2012]. During the development of RDBMS, emerging is
the need to quickly retrieve the data through syntactically and logically
feasible manner, therefore inducing the conceptual design of `SQL`, a structured
querying language. However, with data being stored in a multi-tabular layout,
relational database (RDB) faced massive disadvantages in handling
highly-connected data. Hence the development of schema-less database initiated
by NoSQL [@Berg2012; @Fabregat2018], with graph database being one of its
variants [@Oussous2015].

Graph database is more performant in storing data with intricate relationships,
e.g protein interactions or chemical reaction pathways, as compared to its RDB
counterparts [@Fabregat2018]. `Neo4j` is a graph database platform developed in
`java` and compliant towards ACID system (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability) [@Oussous2015]. As a native graph database, `Neo4j` shall store data
as explicitly defined relationships in a schema-less management system.
Therefore, `Neo4j` treats database querying as a graph traversing process. This
redeeming feature of graph database in general enables higher performance and
flexibility in storing the data. `Neo4j` employs `cypher` as a querying language
to define patterns on traversing the relationship graph. Furthermore, ASCII-Art
syntax of `cypher` enables a more intuitive querying process. Such uniquely
written language and ACID-compliant platform could become a two-fold advantages
to use `Neo4j` in delivering graph database management system.

## Medical Informatics

Information in life science-related fields often possess an intelligible
relationship of causative nature. Many of such information may present as a
connection between one entity to another. Interractome, reactome and connectome
are common examples we may find in currently emerging basic science research. In
translational research paradigm, some interests highlighted the importance of
genetic and proteomic interaction network. Meanwhile in clinical settings, we
may also want to consider patient-doctor-institution as separate yet related
entities. Therefore, the nature of data in medicine is actually a close
resemblance of entity-relationship data. Indubitably, we shall consider
applying graph database as an alternative to RDB to store life science-related
research data.

# Method

This study utilized `Neo4j` as a platform to create graph database with `cypher`
as the querying language. Data used in this study are generated from `synthea`
program, producing 5,000 medical records in json-based FHIR (Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources) which directly converted into `*.csv` format. As
shown in figure \ref{fig:garuda.schema}, we treated each entity as vertex and
underlying relationship as an edge connecting two vertices. We first design
constraints for unique input and indices for redundant vertices. To prevent
random access memory (RAM) bottleneck, we enabled periodic commit for each 500
inputs, which especially beneficial when dealing with numerous entries.
Afterwards, we load `*.csv` file generated by `synthea` as a query object and
finally set the entity and relationship.

```{r lab:garuda.schema}
garuda.schema <- "\\label{fig:garuda.schema} Schematic representation on graph
database for medical records"
```

```{r fig:garuda.schema, fig.cap=paste(garuda.schema)}
knitr::include_graphics('_fig/garuda-schema.jpg')
```

# Result

Constructed database is able to return answer to queries requiring with complex
relationship. We demonstrated the database capability by querying following
syntax:

```{cypher cypher1, echo=T, exec=F}
// List patients with hypertension
match (p:Patient) -[:ATTENDED_AN]-> (e:Encounter)
match (:Diagnoses {Name:'Hypertension'}) <-[:HAS_DIAGNOSES]-
    (e) <-[:PROVIDED_AN]- (o:Organization)
return p, e, o
;
```

In this query, we asked a specific information of patients with hypertension
who attended a certain institution without any time constraint. This query
returned a graph object representing network of patient, institution and
the encounter. To challenge more complicated relationships, we also
performed following query:

```{cypher echo=T, exec=F}
// List diagnoses in Ludlow City
match (p:Patient) -[:ATTENDED_AN]->
    (e:Encounter) <-[:PROVIDED_AN]- 
    (o:Organization) -[:LOCATED_IN]-> (g:GeoLoc)
match (d:Diagnoses) <-[r:HAS_DIAGNOSES]- (e:Encounter)
where g.Name = 'LUDLOW'
return p.Name as Patient,
    d.Name as Diagnoses,
    o.Name as Institution,
    g.Name as City,
    r.Date as Date 
;
```

This query returned a table representing list of diagnoses constrained within
Ludlow City. Figure \ref{fig:dbhits1} and \ref{fig:dbhits2} depicted profile of
database hits from both queries.

```{r lab:dbhits}
dbhits1 <- '\\label{fig:dbhits1} Database hits on the first query'
dbhits2 <- '\\label{fig:dbhits2} Database hits on the secoond query'
```

```{r fig:dbhits1, fig.cap=paste(dbhits1)}
knitr::include_graphics('_fig/query-plan-1.png')
```

```{r fig:dbhits2, fig.cap=paste(dbhits2)}
knitr::include_graphics('_fig/query-plan-2.png')
```

* Show query example
* Show how many db-hits on a query
* Show figures describing query processing (require `Neo4j` browser)

# Discussion

Our study demonstrates graph database as a potential platform to store life
science research data. Previous studies emphasizes on graph database
credibility on storing interconnected data, where graph database pattern query
on such data may outperform RDB [@Medhi2017; @Fabregat2018; @Mathew2014].
However, on other cases requiring analytical query, RDB outperformed graph
database, wherein their study @Holsch2017 argued `Neo4j` became less performant
due to less advanced disk and buffer management compared to RDB.

* Body: graph db as a possible solution, considering the intricate
  relationships of medical information
* Premises on how graph db can be further utilized, maintained and developed
* Conclude the usability of graph db

# Conclusion

Graph database is quite performant to integrate medical health record generated
for 5,000 subjects using `synthea` program.
