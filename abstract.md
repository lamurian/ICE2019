  Indonesia is having an increasing surge of published scientific articles
  during recent years. In medical science, published articles greatly vary
  from both pre-clinical and clinical studies where each study possesses
  different methodological approach and hypothetical premises. However, some
  articles do not include a rigorous documentation as to make it reproducible.
  Moreover, the lack of centralized database further impedes researcher from
  re-analyzing previous findings and integrating them with the new study. This
  paper delineates such an issue by constructing a graph database to
  centralize and integrate clinical research data. Database is constructed using
  `Neo4j` and `cypher` querying language populated with 5,000 medical records
  generated by `synthea` program. Our database able to answer queries
  requiring complex relationship while minimizing the amount of database hits.
  As a concluding remark, graph database is quite performant to solve data
  integration and centralization issue faced by life science research
  institutes.
